## Movie Recommendation System Algorithm

### Overview
The Movie Recommendation System Algorithm is designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. By leveraging machine learning techniques and collaborative filtering, the system aims to provide personalised movie recommendations, enhancing the user experience by helping them discover new and relevant content. The algorithm analyzes user behavior, movie attributes, and various other factors to generate accurate and meaningful recommendations.

### Aim and Objectives

#### Aim
The aim of the movie recommendation system is to enhance user engagement and satisfaction by providing personalized movie recommendations that align with individual tastes and preferences.

#### Objectives
1. **Improve Personalization:** Develop a recommendation algorithm that accurately predicts user preferences based on their viewing history and ratings.
2. **Increase User Engagement:** Enhance user engagement by recommending movies that users are likely to watch and enjoy.
3. **Diversify Recommendations:** Ensure the system can recommend a diverse range of movies, preventing recommendation monotony and encouraging exploration of different genres.
4. **Real-Time Recommendations:** Enable real-time recommendation updates to reflect the latest user interactions and preferences.
5. **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large volumes of data and a high number of users without compromising performance.
6. **User Feedback Integration:** Incorporate user feedback to continuously improve the recommendation accuracy and relevance.

### Methodology
1. **Data Collection:** The dataset used for this project was collected from THE MOVIE DATABASE (TMDB) located in Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** The data was cleaned and preprocess to handle missing values, normalise ratings, and transform categorical data into numerical formats suitable for machine learning algorithms.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Relevant features were extract from the data to improve the performance of the recommendation algorithm, such as user preferences, movie similarities, and implicit feedback.
4. **Model Selection:** Appropriate model was choosen.
5. **Training the Model:** Recommendation Models using historical data, optimizing it to accurately predict user ratings and preferences.
6. **Evaluation:** The models was evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean squared error (MSE) and A/B testing was conducted to compare the recommendation quality against existing systems.
7. **Deployment:** To be continued
